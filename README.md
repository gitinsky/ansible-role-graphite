# Gaphite

This role is set to work with [cyanite]().

Currently working on graphite/api, graphite/carbon and graphite/web seem to be broken.

Default graphite api http port is set to 8001, default graphite api port is 8888.

Don't forget to set ```cyanite_hosts_group```.

# Changelog

- 4.2.2016 Moved graphite/api to graphite/cyanite, implemented native graphite/api.
